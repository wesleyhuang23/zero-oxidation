Each page view gives a simiple explanations on how our bodies are effected by oxidative stress and moves on to explaing why we need anti-oxidants. Learning about orac which is a measurment of the capacity of anti-oxidants to absorb oxidative molecules from damaging our bodies. I provide a list of the top 100 foods that have the highest values and users can search through them with the angular filter. The header animations were done in jQuery.
